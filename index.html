				<h2>About Think Global</h2>
				
				<p>			
					The focus of Think Global is to show the benefits of an international exchange program in which a university student studies and works in a foreign country for a short period of time. 
					Through this exchange program, Think Global hopes to show young people the importance of understanding and learning about societies with a different culture, religion, political, or economic system. 
					In this way, it reflects Think Global’s core values of respect, acceptance, and appreciation of our world’s cultural diversity.
				</p>
				<p>			
					This exchange program provides Auckland students who are studying in their last year of university or who have recently graduated an opportunity to have a paid internship in another country. 
					This not only gives young people valuable work experience to help with future employment, but will also give them a greater appreciation and acceptance of the many ethnicities and cultures around the world. 
					Think Global believes that the divisions and intolerance in our world comes from ignorance and fear of different cultures, nations, or religions. 
					Through these exchange programs, Think Global hopes to inspire students to see the world in a new light, 
					and for them to be motivated to help change the world into a place where everyone can live in peace and be accepting of one another. 
				</p>
				<p>			
					Think Global has a wide variety of exchange programs including countries such as France, Spain, Germany, Russia, USA, Canada and Japan, 
					and each will be short term programs between 1 – 6 months depending on how long a student wants to be abroad for. 
					This means that there is an exchange program suitable for any university student, providing a work opportunity and chance to experience life in a different country. 
					And for those going to a non-English speaking country, there will be a course that aims to teach the basics of the foreign language, and internships will support English-speakers.
